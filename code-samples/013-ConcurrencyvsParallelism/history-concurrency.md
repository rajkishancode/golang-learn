SOME HISTORY ABOUT CONCURRENCY IN GO

- March 2012 go programming language version 1 was released and was open sourced.

- In 2006, intel release its first dual core CPU 
that was first time it was publically available multi-core CPU hit the market place.

- In 2007, Google started to create the Go programming language to natively take advantage of multiple cores.

- All the other programming languages upto that point c,c++,c#,java,javascript,python they were all built   
  prior   to  2006

-  The Go programming language is the first major software programming language ever been built to natively take
   advantage of multiple cores.
   - and that make a huge and significant difference in how we do concurrency with the go programming language  

- If you ever tried to write concurrent code in java or python or other languages , you are probably well familiar 
    with the difficulty and struggles trying to do concurrency on those languages.

- In Go programming language, concurrency is built and baked right in.
- And is built-in to be done in a way which reinforces the ease of programming
- So Concurrency is in the heart of design of Go programming , that makes easy to do concurrency in Go programming 
  language.
