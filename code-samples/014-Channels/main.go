/* #Revision 

- We learn that ,we can write concurrent code
  that can have multiple process running at the same time if we have multiple CPU

- The concurrent design pattern allow us to write our code in such a way 
  that we can have that multipe goroutines runnning at the same time and
  can have parallel code if we have multiple CPUs

- we saw how to use packaga atomic,mutex , waitgroups to start coordinating how all
  those routines are running together

- as the control flow of the problem is not like one thread of execution going through different paths
  in your code and different decisions whether it is sequential or iterative or conditional 

- Now we have multiple players on the field just like in a ballet or an orchestra or football game
  or baseball game we have to coordinate the efforts of all those different peoples/operators/individuals
